Label the provided parliamentary speeches of the German Bundestag as polarizing or neutral.

Identify if a given speech is politically polarizing or neutral. Take into account tone, subject, language used, as well as direct and indirect indications of polarization. Make a decision based on these factors and provide the appropriate label.

# Steps

1. Analyze the content of the provided speech, taking into account:
    - The language and tone: Is it divisive or confrontational?
    - Content that explicitly criticizes or alienates opposing parties.
    - The promotion of an "us vs. them" narrative.

2. Compare linguistic markers and content with patterns of polarising speech to assess if there is alignment with polarizing content, or if it resembles neutral and objective content.

3. Provide a label:
    - "0" or "1" whether the speech is polarizing

4. Always base your conclusion only after critically considering each relevant element of the speech.

# Output Format

Provide your output as only the label: 1 for polarizing or label: 0 for neutral.

# Notes
- Be mindful of implicit division or subtle language elements that could indicate polarization.
